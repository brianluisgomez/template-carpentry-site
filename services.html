                    <p>Got a remodel or other project you need done? Worried about complicated and time-consuming processes making it difficult for you to tackle your project. No need to fear. Here at Your Custom Carpentry, LLC we strive to make your project run smoothly and easily for your convenience. To show how a typical remodel runs, start to finish, we’ve provided a breakdown of what our process looks like below so you know what to expect.</p>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="highlight">Design Phase</h3>
<p>Information correspondence – The first thing we will do is acquire the information we need from you to log the work order and schedule a free, in-home consultation.</p>
<p>In-Home Consultation – Next, we will meet with you on the scheduled date to which we have agreed in order look the project over and take any necessary measurements/photos we need to form a quote.</p>
<p>Designing your space – If pertinent to the type of project we are doing (cabinets, bathroom remodels, deck builds, etc.), we will design a 3D rendering for you to view. We often send this via E-mail first and then discuss the aspects either in person or over the phone (depending on client’s preference/complexity of job). Along with the design we send, we will include an itemized quote that details all the costs related to the project.</p>
<p>Adjustments to Design – Based on the feedback we gather from the client after viewing the first rendering, we will adjust the design and estimate accordingly. Once both client and contractor agree, we will collect the first deposit and begin scheduling the Selection Phase.</p>                                            </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="highlight">Selection Phase </h3>
                        <p>(If pertinent to job type)</p>
                        <p>Scheduling Viewings – The selection phase is all about picking the tiles, fixtures, flooring, cabinets, lighting, etc. that you like and is pertinent to the project. We have a variety of trusted vendors that we use frequently for each of these items. At the start of the selection phase we will work with the client to schedule times that will work for them to view each of the different showrooms and pick out each item they like. As a part of this phase, we will equip the client with a couple of documents they can bring with them to the viewings to help in their selection-making process. They are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1.   Scheduling Itinerary – A detailed schedule Itinerary that shows the locations, times, dates, etc. for each of the vendors at which the client will be viewing items.</p>
                        <p>2.   Budget Tracker – A document that details the budgeted caps for each of the items the customer will be selecting throughout the selection phase.</p>
                        <p>3.   3D Rendering/Blueprints – The renderings/blueprints we developed in the design phase. The vendors will also have this information ahead of time so they can assist the client in a timely and helpful manner.</p>

                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="highlight">Renovation Phase</h3>
                        <p>Permitting – We will acquire any pertinent, required permits that the job entails. This often takes a few weeks to process, so we prefer to file this paperwork at the start of the selection phase so that we are ready to begin demolition/reconstruction by the time all selections are made.</p>
                        <p>Demolition – Not all projects will require a demolition phase, but often renovations entail demolishing old tiles, decks, etc. before updates/changes can be made.</p>
                        <p>Reconstruction/Remodeling – Once the space is prepped for reconstruction, we will begin building the design to which the client has agreed. For remodels, additions, decks, and other projects that require permits, this process has several stages within itself. For smaller projects, aesthetic alterations, and custom trim/cabinet work, the process if simplified a bit more due to the smaller scope of work types required to complete the job. Many projects that require permits entail the following, additional steps:</p>
                        <p>1.	Rough in Phase – Initial framing, plumbing, HVAC, insulation, and electrical work. Requires rough in inspections at various stages.</p>
                        <p>2.	Drywall, flooring, tile, doors, windows, and trim work – Often the next elements to go into a remodel are the main coverings of walls, floor/deck systems, etc. and the initial aesthetics.</p>
                        <p>3.	Fixtures, cabinets, paint, etc. – Next to go in is the cabinets, additional trims, fixtures (both lighting and plumbing), and paint.</p>
                        <p>4.	Final Inspections – At the end of the reconstruction phase, if permits were required on the job, we will have final inspections done. After this passes the project will be complete!</p>
